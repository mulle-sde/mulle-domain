Parses archive and repository URLs like
`https://github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-sde-developer.git` to determine the project
name (`mulle-sde-developer` in this case). Also can compose URLs based on the
hoster domain and the project name.

mulle-domain has a plugin API, to manage multiple hosting domains such as
**github** or **gitlab**.
